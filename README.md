You can start by using an ET Today crawler to scrape news information onto your computer. Then, calculate the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) for each news article to analyze word frequencies and generate a TF-IDF graph for each article. This will help you quickly understand the key points of each news story.
